# Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Search & Deck Builder
A web application that interacts with a MySQL database, which stores Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and decks as well as user accounts with hashed passwords. The database can be queried with card attributes and other criteria, then the web app will display any cards that fulfill that description in a table format. Decks can be built by first choosing a name then adding/deleting cards to/from the deck with that name. Decks are tied to the user who created them. Users can change their username, password, and email; add additional emails; and delete their accounts.
